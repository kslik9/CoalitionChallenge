# CoalitionChallenge


Coalition Challenge is a challenge hosted by 1337 Coding School which was the first Coalitions Championship, a competition where each coalition from each campus will make teams and create projects on the following domains (each coalition with teams for each theme) :

Robotics & Internet Of Things Blockchain & Web3 GameDev & AR/VR AI & Machine Learning

Coalitions are like clans for the student, the total number of students in every campus is divided by the 4 Coalitions we have for me I chose Blockchain & Web3 where I will try to make a web app with web3 integrity

the problematic of the project is that today's education and credential verification systems, face many challenges like efficiency, transparency, and trust. These issues hinder smooth interactions among educational institutions, students, and employers

the solution will Enhance trust and authenticity in academic achievements, mitigating the risk of forgery and fraud. and Implementing decentralized storage for student records ensures enhanced security, data integrity, and privacy Employing smart contracts automates and streamlines the verification processes for employers and educational institutions.

the impact we will have International Recognition of Credentials, Reduction in Credential Evaluation Costs,Enhanced Trust and Authenticity
